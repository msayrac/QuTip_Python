# Here we explore how computers represent numbers and the implications for scientific computing. Weâ€™ll examine:

# Integer representation using binary digits

# Floating-point representation (IEEE 754 standard)

# Precision limitations and their effects on calculations

# Common numerical issues like overflow, underflow, and round-off errors

# Strategies for mitigating precision problems in scientific computing
